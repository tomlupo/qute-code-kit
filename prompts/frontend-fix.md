# Frontend Fix

**Purpose:** For fixing frontend design to achieve a premium, minimalist aesthetic.

## Prompt

```
This frontend looks terrible. Fix in accordance to the following:

Instead of emojis, use icons. Fix the padding so every component is spaced perfectly - not too close to other components but not too dispersed to waste space.

The goal of the site is to look sleek, premium, and minimalist, like a spa in Switzerland. Design this in a way that matches what a working professional would reasonably pay thousands of dollars a month for, in a way that would make Steve Jobs smile.

Avoid using colors unnecessarily, instead pick from a palette that is cohesive and stick to it. Ensure the site is responsive and elegant on both desktop and mobile.
```

## Key Principles

- **Icons over emojis** - Use proper icon libraries (Lucide, Heroicons, etc.)
- **Perfect spacing** - Balanced padding, not cramped or wasteful
- **Premium minimalism** - Swiss spa aesthetic, Steve Jobs approved
- **Cohesive palette** - Limited, intentional color usage
- **Responsive** - Elegant on both desktop and mobile
