**Source:** @doodlestein (Jeffrey Emanuel) - "My Favorite Prompts" series (January 16, 2026)

**Purpose:** For generating and refining project improvement ideas.

## Prompt

```
Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project to make it more robust, reliable, performant, intuitive, user-friendly, ergonomic, useful, compelling, etc. while still being obviously accretive and pragmatic. Come up with 30 ideas and then really think through each idea carefully, how it would work, how users are likely to perceive it, how we would implement it, etc; then winnow that list down to your VERY best 5 ideas. Explain each of the 5 ideas in order from best to worst and give your full, detailed rationale and justification for how and why it would make the project obviously better and why you're confident of that assessment. Use ultrathink.
