# Codebase Exploration

Explore and understand: $ARGUMENTS

## Exploration Process

1. **Search for relevant files** - Use glob patterns and grep to find related code
2. **Read before answering** - Always read files before making claims about them
3. **Map the architecture** - Understand how components connect
4. **Trace data flow** - Follow data from input to output
5. **Identify patterns** - Note conventions and abstractions used

## What to Report

- **Key files** - Main files relevant to the topic
- **Architecture** - How the system is structured
- **Dependencies** - What depends on what
- **Entry points** - Where execution starts
- **Patterns** - Conventions and abstractions in use

## Guidelines

- Don't guess - read the actual code
- Follow imports to understand relationships
- Check tests for usage examples
- Look at git history for context on why things were built this way
