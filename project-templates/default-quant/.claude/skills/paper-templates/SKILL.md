# Research Paper Analysis Templates

Frameworks and templates for analyzing academic papers at different levels of detail.

## Quick Assessment Template

Use for initial paper evaluation (~2 min read):

```markdown
## Paper: [Title]

**Metadata**
- Authors: [List]
- Year: [Publication Year]
- Venue: [Conference/Journal]
- DOI/ArXiv: [Link]

**Quick Summary**
[1-2 sentence overview of the paper's main contribution]

**Relevance Score**: [High/Medium/Low] for [current task]
```

## Deep Analysis Template

Use for papers requiring thorough understanding:

```markdown
## Comprehensive Analysis: [Paper Title]

### Core Contribution
What's the main novelty or advance?

### Problem Statement
What problem does this paper address?

### Methodology
- **Approach**: [High-level description]
- **Key Innovation**: [What's new compared to prior work]
- **Architecture/Framework**: [Technical details]

### Experimental Setup

```

## Executive Summary Template

For non-technical stakeholders:

```markdown
## Paper Summary: [Title]

**What They Did**: [Plain language explanation]

**Why It Matters**: [Significance and impact]

**Key Finding**: [Main result in simple terms]

**Bottom Line**: [Practical implication]
```

## Technical Brief Template

For developers implementing the approach:

```markdown
## Technical Brief: [Title]

**Problem**: [Technical problem statement]

**Solution**: [Proposed approach with technical details]

**Algorithm**:
[Pseudocode or high-level algorithm]

**Results**: [Performance metrics and comparisons]

**Implementation Notes**: [Practical considerations]

**Code**: [If available]
```

## Literature Review Synthesis

For comparing multiple papers on a topic:

```markdown
## Literature Review: [Topic]

**Papers Analyzed**: [Count]
**Date Range**: [Years covered]

### Evolution of Ideas
1. **Early Work ([years])**
   - Focus: [approach]
   - Key papers: [List]
   - Limitations: [Issues]

2. **Current State ([years])**
   - Refined techniques: [Modern approaches]
   - SOTA results: [Best performance]

### Consensus Findings
- [Agreement across papers]
- [Well-established techniques]

### Controversial Areas
- [Disagreements]
- [Conflicting results]

### Research Gaps
- [Under-explored areas]
- [Future directions]
```

## Quick Notes Template

For rapid capture during reading:

```markdown
## Quick Notes: [Paper]

**TL;DR**: [One sentence]

**Why This Matters**: [Relevance]

**Key Idea**: [Main insight]

**Useful For**: [When to apply]

**Remember**: [Most important takeaway]
```

## Paper Credibility Checklist

When assessing paper quality:

- [ ] **Venue**: Top-tier conference/journal?
- [ ] **Authors**: Recognized researchers?
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: Code/data available?
- [ ] **Methodology**: Sound experimental design?
- [ ] **Results**: Statistically significant?
- [ ] **Peer Review**: Rigorous venue?

### Red Flags
- Unrealistic claims without evidence
- Missing experimental details
- No comparison to baselines
- Cherry-picked results
- Lack of ablation studies

## Efficient Reading Strategy

1. **First Pass** (5 min): Title, abstract, figures
2. **Second Pass** (10 min): Introduction, conclusion
3. **Third Pass** (30 min): Methods, results (if relevant)
4. **Deep Dive** (1+ hr): Full careful reading (only if critical)

## Remember

Focus on extracting actionable insights rather than comprehensive summaries. Match the analysis depth to the paper's relevance to your current task.
