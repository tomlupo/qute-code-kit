# Weekly Flow

## Mon/Tue/Wed/Fri
Follow `systems/daily_protocol.md`.

## Thursday
- 15-min prep: use `prompts/tutor_prep.md`
- tutor lesson (conversation-first)
- after lesson: run `prompts/phrase_miner.md` on corrections + add to Anki

## Optional passive input
Podcasts/YouTube are fine as background exposure. If you ever want to “upgrade” passive to active:
- pick 2–3 sentences and shadow them once.
